Note that before starting contributing:

- This repository uses oneflow as its branch management technique, meaning that:
  - There is one branch named `development`
    that is the main branch;
  - The new features are developed on a branch named `feature/<feature_name>` and start from `development`;
  - Bugfixes are developed on a branch named `bugfix/<bugfix_name>` and may start from `development`;
  - Feature and Bugfix branches are merged with:
     ```sh
     git merge --no-ff feature/<feature_name>
     ```
  - In github pullrequests, the merge message is: `merge: merge feature name branch`
- This repository also uses [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), with the commit
  types being:
  - `feat` for features
  - `fix` for bugfixes
  - `chore` for noncode related things, like updating the readme, changing github workflows, updating build scripts,
    etc.
  - `refactor` for code changes that do not add or remove anything aka refactorings
  - `merge` for feature or bugfix branch merges.
- For commit scopes, the issue number can be used...
